### Rules
**Snake**  
(*head*) ðŸ”˜ðŸ’ ðŸ’ ðŸ’ ðŸ’ ðŸ’  (*tail*)
1. The snake **cannot** move in the direction of its tail.
2. Moving in the direction of the tail results in failure (game over).
3. The snake cannot pass through its own body.
4. The snake cannot pass through walls.

**Items**
- For Growth Items âœª : Increase the length of the snake's tail by 1.
- For Poison Items âœ–: Decrease the length of the snake's tail by 1. 
  - If the tail's length becomes less than 3, it's a failure.
- Items appear at random positions where there is no part of the snake's body.
- After a certain time (e.g., 5 seconds), items disappear and reappear at different locations.
- A maximum of 3 items can appear at the same time.

**Gate**  
When the snake enters a gate, it exits through another gate.

**Scoring**
- Calculate the maximum length of the snake during the game: (current length) / (maximum length).
- Count the number of Growth Items collected during the game.
- Count the number of Poison Items collected during the game.
- Count the number of times gates were used during the game.
- Calculate the game time (in seconds).
